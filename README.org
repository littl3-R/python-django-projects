* Intro
  Setting up the project
  1. download and install *python*
  2. create a *virtual environment*
  3. install *django*

* set-up the environment
  #+begin_src bash
    pyenv install --list
    # choose the python version
    pyenv install 3.10.2 # this install the python version
    pyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 udepython
  #+end_src

  then create a file *.python-version*
  =~/udemy/.python-version=
  #+begin_src bash
    cat ../.python-version
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : udepython
** test it
   in the same path
   #+begin_src bash
     django-admin
     python --version
   #+end_src
** installing some packages
   #+begin_src bash
     pip install django black autopep8
   #+end_src
* startproject
  #+begin_src bash
    django-admin startproject mypage
  #+end_src
* More on the Django Template Language (DTL)
  In this course, we're going to use the DTL (Django Template Language)
  a lot - for example also in the big course project (the "Blog"
  project).

  You also saw all the key features in this module already.

  There are three important additions, which you'll see later, but
  which I want to introduce right now already:

  Accessing Dictionary Fields in Templates When accessing dictionary
  data in a template, you DON'T use this syntax:

  #+begin_src html
  {{ myDictionary['some_key'] }}
  #+end_src

  Instead, you use the dot notation - as if it were a regular Python
  object:

  #+begin_src html
  {{ myDictionary.some_key }}
  #+end_src

  This might look strange, but keep in mind, that the DTL is a
  custom-made language. It looks like Python, but ultimately it is NOT
  Python - it's a language parsed and executed by Django. Hence, its
  syntax can deviate - just as it does here.

  Again, you'll see this in action later in the course!

  Calling Functions in Templates Calling functions in templates also
  works differently than it does in Python.

  Instead of calling it, you use functions like regular variables or
  properties.

  I.e., instead of:

  #+begin_src html
  {{ result_from_a_function() }}
  #+end_src

  you would use

  #+begin_src html
  {{ result_from_a_function }}
  #+end_src
* Building Static URLs Dynamically
  Later in the course, we'll see an example for a static URL, that is
  built dynamically.

  What do I mean with that?

  Imagine, that you want to build a static URL where some part of the
  URL (e.g. the filename) is actually stored in a variable that's
  exposed to the template.

  So you might want to build the URL like this:

  #+begin_src html
  {% static "my_path/to/" + the_file %}
  #+end_src

  Here, "the_file" would be a variable holding the actual filename.

  The above code would fail.

  Instead, you can use the "add" filter provided by Django to
  construct this path dynamically:

  #+begin_src html
  {% static "my_path/to/"|add:the_file %}
  #+end_src
* Circular Relations & Lazy Relations

  Sometimes, you might have two models that depend on each other -
  i.e. you end up with a circular relationship.

  Or you have a model that has a relation with itself.

  Or you have a model that should have a relation with some built-in
  model (i.e. built into Django) or a model defined in another
  application.

  Below, you find examples for all three cases that include Django's
  solution for these kinds of "problems": Lazy relationships. You can
  also check out the official docs in addition.

  1) Two models that have a circular relationship

  #+begin_src python
  class Product(models.Model):
  # ... other fields ...
  last_buyer = models.ForeignKey('User')
  
  class User(models.Model):
  # ... other fields ...
  created_products = models.ManyToManyField('Product')
  #+end_src

  In this example, we have multiple relationships between the same two
  models. Hence we might need to define them in both models. By using
  the model name as a string instead of a direct reference, Django is
  able to resolve such dependencies.

  2) Relation with the same model

  #+begin_src python
  class User(models.Model):
  # ... other fields ...
  friends = models.ManyToManyField('self') 
  #+end_src

  The special self keyword (used as a string value) tells Django that
  it should form a relationship with (other) instances of the same
  model.

  3) Relationships with other apps and their models (built-in or custom apps)

  #+begin_src python
  class Review(models.Model):
  # ... other fields ...
  product = models.ForeignKey('store.Product') # '<appname>.<modelname>'
  #+end_src

  You can reference models defined in other Django apps (no matter if
  created by you, via python manage.py startapp <appname> or if it's a
  built-in or third-party app) by using the app name and then the name
  of the model inside the app.
* Deployed
** settings.py
   ref: [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/settings/][here]]
   
   1. NO SHOW the ~SECRET_KEY~ use an env instead
   2. ~DEBUG~ False
   3. ~ALLOWED_HOSTS~
   4. ~DATABASES~ may change
*** Static data
    In production we'll collect in one location
    you have to set up the ~STATIC_ROOT~

    #+begin_src bash
      python manage.py collectstatic
    #+end_src

    This create a new folder with static files, but don't touch these
    files!!  Touch your files as usaul and then if necessary re-run
    the command

    Serve these files from *Django* change in =settings.py=

    Before deployed run:
    1. =python manage.py makemigrations=
    2. =python manage.py migrate=
    3. =python mange.py createsuperuser=
** Virtual Enviroment
   ref: [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments][here]]
   
   =python -m venv django_my_site=
   this command create a new directory
   you have to activate the venv:
   =source ~/my_site/django_my_site/bin/activate=

   then install the packages, in this case:
   =python -m pip install Django Pillow=
   
** Deployed
   Create the ~requirementes.txt~
   =python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt=

** Enviroment Variables
   Change all the domanis which you should be able to send requests

** set-up
   1. create a folder .ebextensions
   2. crate a file =django.config=
      #+begin_example
        option_settings:
          aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
            WSGIPath: my_site.wsgi:application
      #+end_example
   3. create a .zip file not all the folder some files:
      1. .ebextensions
      2. blog
      3. db.sqlite3
      4. manage.py
      5. my_site
      6. requirements.txt
      7. staticfiles
      8. templates
      9. uploads

** back to AWS
   "CONFIGURE MORE OPTIONS"

   there add the Enviromant Variable

   "CREATE APP"
